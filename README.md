### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ola Malmgren, based in a small town called Ã…karp, in a small country called Sweden in a half small region called Europe, on a tiny, tiny planet called Earth in the "solar" system located within the Milky way Galaxy.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at [Boffins Techologies](https://boffins.se/) as founder, partner and ceo, where we among many things develop [nxtedition](http://nxtedition.com/)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m constantly learning **life** (I have 5 kids) but currently also HTML, CSS, Javascript and various backend technologies and frameworks, for example: react, next.js, gatsby, docker, python, django. Setting up and deploy services on for example Amazon Web Services (aws), Google Cloud, Vercel, and many more is something I do quite a bit.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for [the answer on the life, the universe & everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams).
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything! If I dont know the subject I will read up on it. 
- ðŸ“« If you would like to reach me, best is to use email here on github or a social media platform nearby.
