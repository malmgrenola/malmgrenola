### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ola Malmgren, based in a small town called Ã…karp, in a small country called Sweden in a half-small region called Europe, on a tiny, tiny planet called Earth in the "solar" system located within the Milky way Galaxy.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at [Boffins Technologies](https://boffins.se/) as founder, partner and CEO, where we among many things develop [nxtedition](http://nxtedition.com/)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m constantly learning **life** (I have 5 kids) but currently also HTML, CSS, Javascript and various backend and frontend technologies and frameworks, for example: react, next.js, gatsby, docker, python, Django. Setting up and deploying services on for example Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, Vercel, and many more is something I do quite a bit.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for the [Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, and Everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams).
- ðŸ“« If you would like to reach me, the best is to use email here on GitHub or a social media platform nearby.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm an aviator and I hold a Private Pilot license ([PPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_pilot_licence)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_pilot_licence)) ðŸ›©
