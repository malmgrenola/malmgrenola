### Hi there 👋

I'm Ola Malmgren, based in Åkarp, just north of Malmö, Sweden. 

- 🔭 I’m currently spending my time at [Boffins Technologies](https://boffins.se/) as founder, partner and CEO, I am also the co-founder and a partner of [nxtedition](http://nxtedition.com/) & [BST Devices](http://bstdevices.com/).
- 🌱 I’m constantly learning **life** (I have 5 kids) and HTML, CSS, Javascript and various backend and frontend technologies and frameworks, for example: react, next.js, gatsby, docker, python, Django. Setting up and deploying services on for example Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, Vercel, and many more is something I do quite a bit.
- 🤔 I’m looking for the [Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, and Everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams).
- 📫 If you would like to reach me, the best is to use email here on GitHub or a social media platform nearby.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm an aviator and I hold a Private Pilot license ([PPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_pilot_licence)) 🛩
